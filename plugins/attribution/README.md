SCAFFOLD Contract: B02 attribution-readme (plan 002-readme-conformance)
This comment IS the unit's contract. It is removed as part of implementation;
the finished README must not contain it.
Behavior:
  Create this plugin's README from scratch so it conforms exactly to
  plugins/PLUGIN_README_TEMPLATE.md (the locked template; authoritative for
  every section's semantics and placeholder guidance).
Inputs:
  The template; this plugin's actual sources (.claude-plugin/plugin.json,
  skills/*/SKILL.md, hooks/, scripts/, lib/ as present); the existing README
  content below this comment, if any. Facts come ONLY from these sources —
  never invented. If sources contradict this contract or the template seems
  wrong for this plugin, STOP and escalate to the orchestrator.
Outputs:
  A README whose H2 sections are exactly, in order:
    ## Getting started
    ## What to expect
    ## Common workflows
    ## Commands
    ## Relationships to other plugins
    ## Uninstalling
  Extra H2 sections (## Tests, plugin-specific ones) are allowed ONLY
  between "## Commands" and "## Relationships to other plugins".
  H1 is the plugin name followed by a one-paragraph operational purpose
  statement. Getting started opens with the standard install commands
  (/plugin marketplace add cjdubb/clam; /plugin install attribution@clam).
  Uninstalling opens with /plugin uninstall attribution@clam plus any cleanup.
Errors:
  n/a (static document). Ambiguity or contradiction -> escalate, never guess.
Invariants:
  - Every substantive fact in the existing README is preserved by
    RELOCATING it under the correct template heading; nothing is merely
    left in place, nothing substantive is dropped.
  - Pre-existing HTML contract comments in the original content are
    preserved verbatim.
  - Config doctrine (no standalone config section): config written by a
    setup command is documented under that command in ## Commands; env vars
    read by a hook are documented inline with that hook; plugins with many
    env vars get a summary table at the end of ## Commands; any var a user
    must set by hand gets an exact instruction to set it in the env block
    of the settings file at the plugin's installation scope.
  - What to expect and Common workflows are written fresh from plugin
    sources per the template's placeholder guidance.
  - This SCAFFOLD comment is deleted; no other file is touched.
Edge cases / plugin-specific mapping:
  Only component: skills/setup/SKILL.md. Installing is inert until
  /attribution:setup runs; setup writes the attribution settings key at the
  chosen scope (with backup); "setup remove" reverses it; jq required.
  What to expect: nothing changes on install; after setup, commits lose the
  co-author line and PRs the attribution block. Common workflows: suppress
  attribution; restore attribution. Uninstalling: run setup remove BEFORE
  plugin uninstall. Relationships: verify standalone status in sources.
